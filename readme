"""
Simulation known as "Conway's Game of Life", 
a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway in 1970. 
We are going to build it with Python using Pygame.

Rules:
    - A live cell with two or fewer live neighbors dies.
    - A live cell with three live neighbors lives.
    - A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
    - A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive.

Dependencies:
    pip install pygame
